# KZG polynomial commitment scheme 

KZG polynomial commitment scheme allows a committer (Prover) to commit to a polynomial with a short string. Verifier can send Prover a challenge, and of which she creates a proof against the committed polynomial. It has applications into Credentials and Selective Disclosure of Signed Data. ZKS (zero-knowledge sets), and Veriable Secret Sharing (VSS). 
We generate an order of polynomial, and send a random Evaluation Point z: 

```
go run main.go -z 300 -deg 7

$$\ xG ∈ 𝔾_1 $$\ defines a point (x.G ) on 1 curve ($$\ 𝔾_1 \$$) and $$\ xH ∈ 𝔾_2 \$$ defines a point (x.H ) on the other curve ($$\ 𝔾_2 \$$) . Notation used is: 

$$\ [x]_1 = xG ∈ 𝔾_1 \$$
$$\ [x]_2 = xH ∈ 𝔾_2 \$$

and $$\ 𝔾_1 = ⟨G⟩  \$$ and $$\ 𝔾_2 = ⟨H⟩ \$$. 

G is the generator of $$\ 𝔾_1 \$$, and H is the generator of $$\ 𝔾_2 \$$ .

## Trusted Setup 

In the first part, use a Trusted Setup, and should be computed with a Multi-Party Computation (MPC). 

The parameters are generated from random $$\ τ ∈ 𝔽_p \$$, and from this parameter we can compute $$\  [τ^i]_1 \$$ and $$\ [τ^i]_2 \$$ for i=0,...,n−1 : 

$$\
[τ^i]_1 = ([τ^0]_1, [τ^1]_1, [τ^2]_1,...,[τ^{n−1}]_1) 
\$$

$$\
[τ^i]_2 = ([τ^0]_2, [τ^1]_2, [τ^2]_2,...,[τ^{n−1}]_2) 
\$$

Which in additive representation is: 

$$\
(G,τG,τ^2 G,...,τ^{n−1} G) ∈ 𝔾1 
\$$

$$\
(H,τH,τ^2 H,...,τ^{n−1} H) ∈ 𝔾2 
\$$

In this stage, we have taken a random value (τ ) and produced a tuple of size d+1 and where d is the polynomial degree of our target polynomial. We end up with $$\ {G,τG,τ^2 G,τ^3 G,…,τ^d G} \$$. After generating this, the random value of **τ should be deleted** .

## Commitment 

With this we have a polynomial of $$\ p(x)=∑^n _{i=0} p_i x^i \$$, 

and then can create a commitment with: 
$$\ c=[p(τ)]_1 \$$\ 

where $$\ c = ∑^{deg(p(x))} _{i=0} [τ^i]⋅p_i $$\ 

Prover would send this commitment c to Verifier as a proof against the polynomial. 
Verifier would choose a value $$\ z ∈ 𝔽_p \$$, 
where $$\ 𝔽_p \$$ := finite field defined by the polynomial. 

## Evaluating the proof 

Prover computes p(z)=y , and a quotient polynomial is derived as: 
$$\ q(x) = \frac{p(x)−y}{x−z} \$$. 

This polynomial proves that p(z)=y , and where p(x)−y is divisible by x−z . 
This means it has a root at z, as p(z)−y = 0 . 

The evaluation proof is: $$\ π = [q(τ)]_1 \$$ and which is determine from $$\ π = ∑^{deg(q(x))} _{i=0} [τ^i]⋅q_i \$$

Prover can send this evaluation proof π to Verifier. 

## Verifying the proof 

Verifier has the commitment of $$\ c=[p(τ)]_1 \$$ , the evaluation of y=p(z) , and the proof of $$\ π=[q(τ)]_1 \$$ . He can now check the pairing of: 

$$\ ê (π,[τ]_2−[z]_2)==ê (c−[y]_1,H) \$$

Prover provides π and c are given by prover before, and where $$\ [τ]_2 \$$ is derived in the trusted setup, $$\ [z]_2 \$$ defines the point at which the polynomial has been evaluated with, and $$\ [y]_1 \$$ defines the claimed value of p(z) . 

This works because: 

$$\ ê (π,[τ]_2−[z]_2)==ê (c−[y]_1,H) \$$

$$\ ⇒ ê ([q(τ)]_1,[τ−z]_2)==ê ([p(τ)]_1−[y]_1,H) \$$

$$\ ⇒[q(τ)⋅(τ−z)]_T==[p(τ)−y]_T \$$

Note: we have q(x)(x−z)=p(x)−y , and which can be rearranged as $$\ q(x)=\frac{p(x)−y}{x−z} \$$. 
This is evaluated at τ for the trusted setup and not known for $$\ q(τ) = \frac{p(τ)−y}{τ−z} \$$.
